# attention 10.81, embed+lm_head 2.36, the three dense MLPs 1.08, shared experts 1.01,
# MTP 0.20 -- is 15.46 GiB.  So the die holds 15.46 + 1.009*N GiB of weights:

# left and there is several GiB of slack for the dynamic allocations (the KDA layers ask
# the Triton runtime for a ~3 GiB workspace on a multi-thousand-token prefill).
#
# Streaming prefill reserves a 7.25 GiB convert-output slot BEFORE KV sizing, and that
# does not fit at 0.85 -- the scheduler refuses to start ("Loaded weights leave no GPU
# memory for the KV cache", minimum viable measured 0.887).  Raising the fraction alone
# swings too far the other way: KV then grows to fill it (190656 tokens on one A3 die,
# far more than a 32768 context with one running request can use) and the first long
# prefill aborts on that Triton workspace.  So streaming needs BOTH -- a higher fraction
# so the slot fits, and a KV pool capped near the context length so the slack survives.
# Measured on one die (61.28 GiB usable): weights+slot 54.11, KV@40960 0.65, decode graph
# ~2.0, leaving ~4.5 GiB dynamic.
#
# ⚠ The chunk size is part of this budget, not an independent knob. The KDA workspace
# scales with the tokens in one forward, and on the streaming path there is only ~5.5 GiB
# left for it. Measured on die 8, K=32, identical in every other respect:
#     chunked-prefill 8192 -> KDA asks 3.00 GiB with 3.03 GiB free -> OutOfMemoryError,
#                             SIGABRT in eager_runner._execute_extend. Twice, and once on
#                             a freshly started server, so it is not fragmentation.
#     chunked-prefill 6144 -> verify.sh ALL CHECKS PASSED on its 14379-token prompt.
# The hybrid path has no 6.75 GiB slot and runs at 0.85, so it keeps 8192.

# A sourced script shares the caller's positional parameters, so `$1` here used to be

# where die 0 belongs to somebody else. The A2 byte-identity gate is safe only because it
